                <h2>Career Interests</h2> 
                <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
                <p>I am not sure what I would like to be when I grow up, but my top 3 are, 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Veterinarian</li>
                        <li>Photographer</li>
                        <li>Teacher</li> 
                    </ol>
                    For a part time job Highschool, I would like to work at Sephora because 
                    I love to do my makeup or my friends makeup. I know a lot about makeup, 
                    and when I say a lot I mean A LOT. </p>

        <h2>High School/ Collage Choices</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
            <p>For highschool, I would like to go to Lakewood because, when we went to 
                Lakewood for the field trip last year, I saw that they have a very nice 
                photography progam and I would like to become a photographer when I 
                get older. For my 12th birthday I was gifted by my parents with a Cannon 
                rebel T6 camera. I was so happy and excited. It's been a year and I have 
                taken over 1,000 pictures on my camera. I love to take pictures of nauture, 
                my dogs, my parents, food and sometimes my friends if they want to do a mini 
                photo shoot, I really enjoy it. For my collage choice, I am not so sure yet, 
                but it would be nice to take some class at LBCC in the future. </p>

            <h2>Goals in Life</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
                <p>I don't have that many big goals in life, but my most important one is to
                stay close with my parents and brother because I would like to have a closer 
                realsionship with them. I would also like to keep playing volleyball with 
                all the free time that I have. I would also like to be successful, but I 
                mean everyone wants to be successful. I would like to have a big family when 
                I get older. </p>
