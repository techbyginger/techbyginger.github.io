        <h2>6th Grade</h2>
            <img src="longBeachPoster" alt="A poster about Long Beach,CA" width="250">   
            <p>In 6th grade we learned the basics about typing and using computers. We gradually
               would start to do more and more projects. For me 6th grade ATM was kinda difficult because 
               I was under so much pressure to get my WPM up. We used Microsoft Word almost every day. We also 
               used PowerPoint to make slide shows. Here the links to my slide about Tokyo. <a href="https:
                //docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rBOIzAyezRbxXBNhuOyx3htIErkyo2ecT0biyivSel8/edit?usp=sharing" Tokyo Slide></a> 
                We used google drawings to make posters of the city we would like to travel too.Through out the 
                year we learned about 
               Internet Safety.

        <h2>7th Grade</h2>
        <img src="#" alt="" width="">        
            <p>It was even more challenging in 6th grade then 7th grade. We learned a new lesson almost every day. For me it was fun 
            to use computers every day. I liked the fast pase lessons every day. Every day was a new fun challenge to over come to 
            make we smater and work harder. When I was in Ms.McClure's class we learned how to use InDesign and Photoshop. In 
            Ms.Miltion's class we learned how to use Sketchup, FloorPlanner and Karel.</p></article>

        <h2>8th Grade</h2>
        <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
            <p>So far 8th grade ATM has been my favorite year. We get make our own creations such as this website. This year we learned
            how to code HTML and css in khan academy. We started to advance coding by using dash and visul studio code. </p></article>
