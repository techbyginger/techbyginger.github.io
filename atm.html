        <h2>6th Grade</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
            <p>In 6th grade we learned the basics about typing and using computers. We gradually
               would start to do more and more projects. For me 6th grade ATM was kinda difficult because 
               I was under so much pressure to get my WPM up. We used Microsoft Word almost every day. 
               Through out the year we learned about Internet Safety.</p></article>

        <h2>7th Grade</h2>
        <img src="#" alt="" width="">        
            <p>It was even more challenging in 6th grade then 7th grade. We learned a new lesson almost every day. For me it was fun 
            to use computers every day. I liked the fast pase lessons every day. Every day was a new fun challenge to over come to 
            make we smater and work harder. </p></article>
