        <h2>My family</h2>
            <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
            <p>In my family, there is my mom, dad, brother and me. We also have two dogs, Roxy and zoe. <br> 
            Roxy a husky lab mix (she is chubby but so sweet). Zoe is a maltese poodle, but she is the little diva, <br> 
            she gets all the attention from everyone, my friends, parents, and other family members. My dad works <br> 
            as a union electrician, he works all over California. My mom, is a housekeeper/ nanny for a couple in <br> 
            Beverly Hills. She had been working for them for the past three and a half years. My brother is 20, 
            <br> he is working almost every day. I am proud of him because he was almost a high school dropout, 
            but <br> he worked hard in summer school and he graduated senior year. My dad was born and raised in a little <br> 
            town in Maine. My mom was born and raised in Guadalajara, Mexico. My family and I love to go out to <br> 
            eat Thai food, sushi, poki bowls and more. We all enjoy cooking together and making our own creations.</p>

            <p>I type about 35-40 wpm. I am fairly good at coding. I make some of the best waffles I've ever had. 
            <br> They are fluffy, thick, and delicious. I also make some really homemade pizza (thanks to Grandma <br>
            Grass for the dough recipe). In volleyball, I am one of the best diggers on my club team. I am a pretty<br>  
            good outside hitter too. I am also skilled at

        <h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>
        <img src="#" alt="" width="">   
            <p>For a hobbie of mine, I play volleyball. It helps me get my mind off of school or family things. I have 
                been playing volleyball for a about 3 and a half years but only for fun. This year I started to get more 
                serious with volleyball by joining a club team. I made a 14's team even though I am barely going to be 13 
                in like 10 days! I also enjoy cooking, baking. I like to cook and bake because you don't necessary have 
                to follow a recipe, you can make your own creations. One of my biggest things I would like to do in my life
                is to travel around the world and see all the different cultures and traditions. I would also like to travel 
                the world so I can take pictures of my experiences. Another interest is to learn spanish so I can have a 
                better relationship with my tias and tios, because most of them only speak spanish. </p></article>
